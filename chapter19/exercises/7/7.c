 *    Description:  Modify the stackADT2.c so that a stack automatically doubles its si-
 *                  ze when it becomes full. Have the push function dynamically allocate
 *                  a new array thats twice as large as the old one and then copy the 
 *                  stack contents from the old array to the new one. Be sure to have 
 *                  push dealocate the old array once the data has been copied.
