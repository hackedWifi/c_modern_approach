// The islower function, which belongs to the <ctype.h>, tests whether a character
// is a lower case letter. Why would the following macro version of is lower not be
// legal, according to the C standard?

// #define islower(c) ((c) >= 'a' && (c) <= 'z')

// The C99 Standard in the Macro replacement section 6.10.3 Constraints, 
stipulates that an identifier currently defined as a function-like macro shall 
not be redefined by another #define preprocessing directive unless the second
definiton is a function-like macro definition that has the same number and spe-
lling of parameters, and the two replacement are identical.
