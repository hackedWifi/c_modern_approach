 *    Description:  The justify program of Section 15.3 justifies lines by insertin extra
 *                  spaces between words. The way the write_line function currently works,
 *                  the words closer to the end of a line tend to have slightly wider gaps
 *                  between them that the words at the beginning. (For example, the words
 *                  closer to the end might have three  spaces between them, while the
 *                  words closer to the beginning might be separated by only two spaces.)
 *                  Improvew the program by having write_line alternate between putting 
 *                  the larger gaps at the end of the line and putting them at the 
 *                  beginning of the line.
